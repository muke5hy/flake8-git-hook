flake8 Git Commit Hook
====================

This is a pre-commit hook for Git that checks the code to be committed
for Python flake8 style compliance.  The hook will prevent the commit in
case style violations are detected. It uses tox.ini for flake8 settings

Installation:

1. Install the flake8 program: ```$ pip install flake8```
2. Save pre-commit as your_project/.git/hooks/pre-commit
3. Mark pre-commit executable: ```$ chmod +x your_project/.git/hooks/pre-commit```

The hook can be overridden: ```$ git commit --no-verify```

Currently, the following flake8 codes are checked for:

E111 indentation is not a multiple of four   
E125 continuation line does not distinguish itself from next logical line   
E203 whitespace before ':'   
E261 at least two spaces before inline comment   
E262 inline comment should start with '# '   
E301 expected 1 blank line, found 0   
E302 expected 2 blank lines, found 1   
E303 too many blank lines (2)   
E502 the backslash is redundant between brackets   
E701 multiple statements on one line (colon)   
E711 comparison to None should be 'if cond is None:'   
W291 trailing whitespace   
W293 blank line contains whitespace   

In case you want to modify the list of codes to ignore, edit the
```ignore_codes``` list in the pre-commit file.   
If you want to select only specific codes to scan for, use the
```select_codes``` list.
Additional arguments to the flake8 program (e.g., ```--max-line-length=120```) can be added to the ```overrides``` list.
